                <p>
                    Curbside Thai brings the rich flavor of Thailand to
                    North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35
                    years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers
                    that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte
                    with our modern mobile food truck.
                </p>

                This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy
                paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various
                mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from
                11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and
                11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the
                difference! If you can't get away from your desk,
                Curbside Thai will deliver.

                Contact us to cater your next party and experience
                what Carolina Traveler calls the finest Asian food
                on or off the streets of Charlotte.
